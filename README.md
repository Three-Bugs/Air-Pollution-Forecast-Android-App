## üî• Pitch:
## Problem Statement
Air Pollution Forecast using Prophet, and suggesting various ways to reduce it on an Individual Level.

## Implementation and Coding
Our Application shows a week-long Air Pollution Forecast (AQI), alarming the citizen to avoid going out on that specific day if the AQI level is at the dangerous level. We have also shown how an individual can make a difference by his or her efforts by showing how the AQI will be affected if even a single citizen doesn‚Äôt drive gasoline vehicle for a day. We have also shown the statistics of various sources that account for air pollution. Along with that, we will be featuring the citizens on our app those who are making efforts to feel them appreciated. We have also shown blogs on the effects of air pollution on humans and the environment.

## Tools used
Android Studio
R studio

## Results
Every year around 12 lakh people die in India due to Air Pollution. The condition in Delhi is getting deadly. In that case, this app will definitely try to help reduce the number of deaths and prevent various diseases by generating a sense of awareness on an Individual level.

## Future Scope
We will try to open source our technology so that it can be used for predictions of other alarming issues like forest fires, number of trees, acid rain, various disasters, etc.
